# WiiLink Patcher GUI
WiiLink Patcher GUI is a Python program built around the excellent [libWiiPy](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/libWiiPy) to make WiiLink patching a simple process, with a streamlined graphical user interface.

## Downloading
You can download the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink-Patcher-GUI/releases).

> **NOTE:** In **Windows**, your antivirus may flag the **patcher** as malware. This is a **false positive**, and you can safely ignore it. If you are still unsure, you can inspect the source code, and/or compile it yourself for extra verification. You can also temporarily disable your antivirus to download the patcher, or add an exception for it if you put it in a dedicated folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Linux
- ```qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.```:
> - This is a common issue on Debian, Ubuntu and their derivatives (i.e. Linux Mint). To resolve this issue, install the `libxcb-cursor-dev` package on your system.
